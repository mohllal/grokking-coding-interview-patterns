# Pattern: Two Pointers

The two pointers technique uses two pointers (or indices) to traverse the sequence (such as an array, string, or linked list) simultaneously in order to get the answer faster.

Forms:

1. Two pointers either move towards each other or move in the same direction.
2. Two pointers moving in different pace, starting from the same position or different positions.

This folder contains code for the classic form of the two pointers technique, where **the pointers either start from opposite ends of a sequence and move towards each other or begin at the same point and move together.**.

This technique is often used in problems that require finding pairs or sub-arrays that satisfy certain conditions (e.g., sum of two elements, checking for a palindrome).
