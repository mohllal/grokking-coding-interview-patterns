# Pattern: Two Pointers

The two pointers technique uses two pointers (or indices) to simultaneously traverse the sequence (such as an array, string, or linked list) either by moving toward each other or in a particular direction until they meet.

This technique is often used in problems that require finding pairs or sub-arrays that satisfy certain conditions (e.g., sum of two elements, checking for a palindrome).
