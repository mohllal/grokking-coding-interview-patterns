# Pattern: Fast and Slow Pointers

The fast and slow pointer technique, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the sequence (such as an array, string, or linked list) at different speeds.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic linked list), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.
