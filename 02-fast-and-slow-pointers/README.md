# Pattern: Fast and Slow Pointers

The two pointers technique uses two pointers (or indices) to traverse the sequence (such as an array, string, or linked list) simultaneously in order to get the answer faster.

Forms:

1. Two pointers either move towards each other or move in the same direction.
2. Two pointers moving in different pace.

This folder contains the second form of the two pointers technique where **the two pointers move in different pace.**.

This technique is often used in problems that require finding specific patterns in sequences (e.g., slow/fast pointers for cycle detection).
