# Pattern: Sliding Window

The sliding window technique involves maintaining a fixed or variable-sized window of contiguous subarrays that "slides" over a sequence (such as an array or string) to perform operations on the elements within the window.

This technique is often used for solving problems that require processing or analyzing all contiguous subarrays of a given size or that meet specific conditions, with the window size sometimes being dynamicâ€”expanding or shrinking based on problem-specific constraints to optimize the solution.
